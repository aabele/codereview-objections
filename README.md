# Code reviewer objections

Compilation of most annoying peer reviewer objections. (PRs are welcome)

* Are designers happy about this?
* Single quotes should be converted to double
* I would call `variableA` as `variableB`
* I think we should not merge this yet
* Lets talk about how much refactoring we should do
* Doesn't `VariableB` sound better?
* What is this for?
